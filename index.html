                Online learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken
                in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate
                synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue
                to transform as well.

                Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self; transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed processes such as appreciatively accessing
                and receiving the symbolic contents of the unconscious and critically analyzing underlying premises. Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. Jack Mezirow believes that it usually results from
                a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transitionâ€”although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time. Less dramatic predicaments, such as those
                created by a teacher, also promote transformation. Online learning emerged in 1982 when the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California opened its School of Management and Strategic Studies. The School employed computer
                conferencing to deliver a distance education program to business executives.[2] In 1989 the University of Phoenix began offering education programs through the internet. In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser, created
                by the University of Illinois, online learning began to flourish. In 1998, the first fully online programs were founded: New York University Online, Western Governor's University, the California Virtual University and Trident University
                International.

                Online Learning Management
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag para-sm">
                Most online learning occurs through a college's or university's learning management system (LMS). A LMS is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking educational resources. According to the Educause Center for Analysis and Research
                (ECAR) use of a LMS is nearly ubiquitous as 99% of colleges and universities report having one in place. Among faculty, 87% report using a LMS and find them useful for "enhancing teaching (74%) and student learning (71%)". Similarly, 83%
                of students use an LMS in their courses, with the majority (56%) using them in most or all courses. ECAR's survey of institutions found that generally, both faculty and students are satisfied with the LMS; with three-quarters satisfied
                with the LMS for posting content (faculty) and accessing content (students). In contrast, the lowest levels of satisfaction with the LMS reported by faculty were with features that allow for "meaningful" interaction between students and
                their instructor, students and other students, and for study groups or collaborating on projects (p. 12). Similarly, just under half of the students surveyed reported satisfaction of the LMS for "engaging in meaningful interactions with
                students"
